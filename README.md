## Why?

[openISP](https://github.com/cruxopen/openISP) is a Python reference implementation of a classic
image signal processing pipeline. [fast-openISP](https://github.com/QiuJueqin/fast-openISP) is its
successor: a drop-in, NumPy-vectorized rewrite that gets the same pipeline running **over 300x
faster** on the CPU.

HyperISP picks up where fast-openISP leaves off. The pipeline stages are inherently
data-parallel. Each one maps a function over every pixel of a frame, which makes them a natural
fit for the GPU. By re-implementing the pipeline in C++/CUDA, HyperISP aims to take the same
algorithms several steps further: from "fast enough to batch-process on a CPU" to "fast enough
for real-time, frame-by-frame processing".

## Overview

HyperISP is written in modern C++/CUDA. Each pipeline stage is an independent `IspBlock` that
operates on shared `PipelineData` (Bayer, demosaiced RGB, and YCbCr frame buffers), launched on a
CUDA stream. Per-camera tuning is read from a TOML config file (see [`configs/`](configs)), which
also controls which blocks are enabled.

### Pipeline

Mirroring the fast-openISP pipeline, the following stages are planned:

- [x] **DPC** — Dead Pixel Correction
- [x] **BLC** — Black Level Compensation
- [ ] **AAF** — Anti-aliasing Filter
- [ ] **AWB** — Auto White Balance
- [ ] **CNF** — Chroma Noise Filtering
- [ ] **CFA** — Color Filter Array Demosaicing
- [ ] **CCM** — Color Correction Matrix
- [ ] **GAC** — Gamma Correction
- [ ] **CSC** — Color Space Conversion
- [ ] **NLM** — Non-Local Means Denoising
- [ ] **BNF** — Bilateral Noise Filtering
- [ ] **CEH** — Contrast Enhancement
- [ ] **EEH** — Edge Enhancement
- [ ] **FCS** — False Color Suppression
- [ ] **HSC** — Hue & Saturation Control
- [ ] **BCC** — Brightness & Contrast Control
- [ ] **SCL** — Scaling

## Performance

## Quick start

**Requirements:**
- CMake 3.20 or higher
- CUDA Toolkit (nvcc 13.3 is preferable) with a C++23-capable host compiler
- Git (for fetching the `tomlplusplus` dependency)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/moesay/hyperISP.git
cd hyperISP

# Configure and build
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build

# Run on the default config and test RAW
./build/cudaISP configs/nikon_d3200.toml
```

## Configuration

Each camera/sensor has its own TOML config under [`configs/`](configs), describing the sensor
layout (resolution, bit depth, Bayer pattern) and the tunable parameters for every pipeline stage,
plus a per-block enable/disable switch.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome — feel free to fork the repo, open issues, and submit pull requests for
new pipeline blocks, optimizations, or fixes.

Before opening a PR, please format any C++/CUDA changes with the `.clang-format` config provided
at the project root (4-space indentation, no tabs):

```bash
clang-format -i <changed files>
```

and make sure the project still builds with `cmake --build build`.
